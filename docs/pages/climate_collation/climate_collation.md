### Analysis of Notebooks in scripts/climate_collation

The directory `scripts/climate_collation` contains two Jupyter notebooks: `build_timeseries.ipynb` and `new_build_reference_table.ipynb`. These notebooks form a workflow for processing geospatial climate data from the SILO dataset to generate timeseries for hydrological modeling, specifically for subcatchments in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) region. The first notebook builds a reference table mapping subcatchments to climate grid cells, while the second extracts and collates daily rainfall and potential evapotranspiration (PET) timeseries. Below is a comprehensive summary for each notebook, structured under the requested headings.

#### build_timeseries.ipynb

### 1. The main purpose and objectives of the notebook

This notebook extracts daily climate timeseries data for rainfall and potential evapotranspiration (PET) from SILO NetCDF files, tailored to specific subcatchments in predefined regions of the GBR. The primary objective is to create weighted averages of climate variables based on the spatial overlap between subcatchment boundaries and the SILO climate grid, producing CSV files suitable for input into rainfall-runoff models like those used in the Source hydrological modeling framework. It relies on a pre-built reference table to determine grid cell contributions, focusing on regions such as 'CY' (and extensible to 'BM', 'BU', 'FI', 'MW', 'WT') for years starting from 2024 onward. The process ensures data collation into region-specific directories for easy integration into environmental modeling workflows.

### 2. Key code logic and functions implemented

The core logic revolves around loading annual NetCDF files from SILO, selecting nearest grid points based on subcatchment coordinates and weights from the reference table, and computing weighted sums for each subcatchment. Key imports include `xarray` for NetCDF handling, `pandas` for data manipulation, `geopandas` (though minimally used here), and `tqdm` for progress tracking.

The main function, `build_timeseries(region, year_range, component)`, iterates over years in the range:
- For each year, it loads the NetCDF dataset (`xr.open_dataset`) for the specified component ('rain' or 'pet'), extracting the 'time' index.
- It initializes a zero array for data storage, sized by the number of unique subcatchments and daily timesteps.
- Using a loop over subcatchments (with `tqdm` for progress), it queries the reference table for fragments (grid cells overlapping each subcatchment).
- For each fragment, it selects the nearest longitude/latitude point via `ds.sel(lon=xx, lat=yy, method='nearest')`, multiplies the variable (e.g., `daily_rain` or `et_morton_wet`) by the `grid_weight` (area proportion), and accumulates into the data array.
- The transposed data is converted to a `pandas.DataFrame` with subcatchments as columns and time as the index, then concatenated across years.
- Output is saved as a single CSV per region-component (e.g., 'CY_rain_timeseries.csv').

A secondary function, `do_collation(region, component)`, reads the timeseries CSV and reformats it into individual per-subcatchment files (e.g., 'rainfall for SUB001.csv') in a region-specific output directory (e.g., 'CY_collation/'), with 'Date' as the first column followed by the variable values. This handles the CSV's 'time' column by renaming it to 'Date' and exporting without index.

Execution loops over regions (e.g., ['CY']) and components (['rain', 'pet']), calling both functions sequentially.

### 3. Important findings or results shown in outputs

The notebook does not include executed cells with outputs in the provided content, but based on the code, expected results include:
- Weighted timeseries CSVs aggregating daily values across subcatchments, preserving the original SILO temporal resolution (daily from 2024 to 2025).
- Collation outputs as separate CSVs per subcatchment, facilitating direct import into modeling software; for example, for the 'CY' region with rainfall, this would generate files like 'rainfall for CY001.csv' containing dates and corresponding mm values.
- Progress prints (e.g., "running year 2024") and directory creation confirmations (e.g., "Directory 'CY_collation' was created.") during runtime.
No quantitative findings like statistics or visualizations are computed or displayed; the focus is on data preparation rather than analysis.

### 4. Overall structure and flow

The notebook begins with imports and configuration variables (e.g., `region='CY'`, `component='rain'`, `start_year=2024`, `finish_year=2025`), followed by loading the `reference_table.csv`. It defines `build_timeseries` to process NetCDF data into a concatenated timeseries DataFrame and save it. A redundant inline version of the timeseries building logic follows, likely for testing. An admonition note explains the collation step, leading to directory creation and a manual collation block (later refactored into `do_collation`). The flow culminates in a loop calling both functions for each region-component combination, ensuring timeseries are built before collation. The structure is iterative and modular, with clear separation between data extraction and file formatting, though some code duplication exists (e.g., inline loops mirroring the function).

### 5. Instructions for use

To use this notebook:
- Ensure the `reference_table.csv` (generated by `new_build_reference_table.ipynb`) is in the working directory.
- Set `region` to one of ['BM', 'BU', 'FI', 'MW', 'CY', 'WT'] and `component` to 'rain' or 'pet'.
- Adjust `start_year` and `finish_year` for the desired range (NetCDF paths assume annual files on drive 'F:/' or 'J:/').
- Update NetCDF prefixes if paths differ (e.g., 'F:/TS/ClimateInputs/NetCDFdumps/Rainfall_Daily/' for rain).
- Run the cells sequentially; the main execution loop at the end will process all combinations in `region_list` and `component_list`.
- Outputs appear in `{region}_collation/` as per-subcatchment CSVs. For production, extend `region_list` to all GBR areas and verify SILO file availability.
- Requires libraries: `xarray`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `geopandas`, `tqdm`. Run in a Jupyter environment with access to the specified drives.

### 6. Theoretical Description of Methods

The method employs spatial interpolation via area-weighted averaging to assign gridded climate data to irregular subcatchment polygons. For a subcatchment $S$ with area $A_S$, and overlapping grid cells $G_i$ (each of area $A_{G_i}$), the value $V_S(t)$ at time $t$ is computed as:
$$
V_S(t) = \sum_{i} w_i \cdot V_{G_i}(t),
$$
where $w_i = \frac{A_{S \cap G_i}}{A_S}$ is the areal fraction of intersection, ensuring conservation of mass (e.g., total rainfall volume). This Thiessen-like approach uses nearest-neighbor selection (`method='nearest'`) for point extraction from the 5 km SILO grid, assuming uniform distribution within cells. For PET, Morton's wet-surface evaporation model is used, which estimates potential evapotranspiration under wet conditions via energy balance principles involving solar radiation, temperature, and humidity, though details are encapsulated in the SILO data. The projection to EPSG:3577 minimizes area distortion for Australian latitudes, preserving accurate overlap calculations via `geopandas` intersections (though not directly used in extraction).

#### new_build_reference_table.ipynb

### 1. The main purpose and objectives of the notebook

This notebook constructs a geospatial reference table linking subcatchment boundaries in the GBR to the SILO climate grid, enabling subsequent weighted extraction of climate data. The objective is to compute area-based weights for each subcatchment-grid cell overlap, producing a CSV (`reference_table.csv`) with columns for subcatchment ID, region, grid index, weight, and centroid coordinates. It targets six GBR regions ('BM', 'BU', 'FI', 'MW', 'CY', 'WT'), transforming all data to EPSG:3577 for consistency with SILO's projection, ultimately supporting accurate downscaling of gridded climate variables to hydrological model inputs.

### 2. Key code logic and functions implemented

Imports focus on geospatial tools: `pandas` and `geopandas` for data handling and spatial operations. Paths are set to shapefiles: a national climate grid (`Fishnet_AUS_ClimateGrid.shp`) and per-region subcatchment files (e.g., 'BM/Catchmt.shp').

The workflow loads and reprojects the climate grid to EPSG:3577 if needed (`to_crs`). The key function `get_areas(subcatchment, region)` processes one subcatchment:
- Queries the subcatchments GeoDataFrame for the polygon by 'Catchmt' ID, buffering to resolve any geometry issues (`buffer(0)`).
- Computes intersections with the climate grid using `intersects`.
- For each intersecting grid cell $i$, calculates the intersection polygon (`intersection`), its area proportion $w_i = \frac{\text{area}(S \cap G_i)}{A_S}$, and the original centroid (x, y) from the unprojected grid.
- Accumulates records into a dictionary list with fields: 'subcatchment', 'region', 'subcat_area', 'grid_index', 'grid_weight', 'x', 'y'.

The main loop iterates over regions, loads each subcatchments shapefile, sets its CRS to EPSG:3577, extracts unique 'Catchmt' IDs, and calls `get_areas` for each, appending to a result list. Finally, `pd.DataFrame(result_list)` is saved as 'reference_table.csv' without index.

Some inline code (e.g., loading for 'BM') appears as testing artifacts.

### 3. Important findings or results shown in outputs

No executed outputs are present, but the resulting `reference_table.csv` would contain rows per subcatchment-grid overlap, e.g., for a subcatchment spanning multiple cells, multiple entries with weights summing to approximately 1.0 (verifiable via $\sum w_i \approx 1$). Prints include CRS details (e.g., "CRS for shapefile EPSG:4283") and progress ("running process for BM"). The table enables validation of coverage, such as total subcatchment area and grid resolution (5 km cells). Potential insights include fragmentation: subcatchments near boundaries may rely on fewer/heavily weighted cells, affecting interpolation accuracy.

### 4. Overall structure and flow

The notebook opens with a detailed header (title, description, authors, run instructions, and a sample table image), explaining the output format and EPSG:3577 rationale. Imports and path configurations follow, with loading and reprojection of the climate grid. Inline testing for 'BM' (loading, CRS setting) precedes the `get_areas` function definition. The primary execution loop processes all regions sequentially, building the result list before creating and saving the DataFrame. The flow is geospatial-first: load globals, define per-entity processor, aggregate via loop, export. It's concise, with minimal redundancy except for the 'BM' test block.

### 5. Instructions for use

Prerequisites: Install `geopandas` and `pandas`; ensure shapefiles are at specified paths (e.g., 'D:/gdrive/My Drive/Work Projects/Climate_Collation_Script/shapefiles/...'). The climate grid must be in a compatible CRS (auto-reprojects if not EPSG:3577). Subcatchment directories ('BM/', etc.) should contain 'Catchmt.shp' with 'Catchmt' ID column.

To run:
- Update paths if needed (e.g., for different drives).
- Execute cells top-to-bottom; the loop at the end processes all regions in `regions = ['BM', 'BU', 'FI', 'MW', 'CY', 'WT']`.
- Outputs 'reference_table.csv' in the working directory, ready for `build_timeseries.ipynb`.
- For subsets, modify the `regions` list. Verify geometries post-run (e.g., check weight sums per subcatchment == 1). Use in a Jupyter notebook with sufficient memory for large shapefiles.

### 6. Theoretical Description of Methods

The approach uses polygon overlay analysis to derive areal weights for gridded data disaggregation. For subcatchment polygon $S$ and grid cells $G_i$, intersections are computed in a projected CRS (EPSG:3577, Australian Albers Equal Area Conic) to ensure metric area calculations:
$$
w_i = \frac{\text{area}(S \cap G_i)}{\text{area}(S)},
$$
where areas are in square meters, preserving total flux (e.g., rainfall integrates correctly). Centroids from the source grid (likely EPSG:4283, GDA94) provide lon/lat for NetCDF selection, assuming bilinear or nearest-neighbor approximation suffices for 5 km resolution. Buffering (`buffer(0)`) fixes self-intersections via the even-odd rule. This inverse distance weighting variant (area-based) reduces bias in heterogeneous terrains, aligning with standard hydrological downscaling practices for conserving domain totals.
