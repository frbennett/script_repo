## Utilities

| Notebook | Description | 
|----------|----------|
| [admonition_notes](../pages/utilities/admonition_notes.md) | This Jupyter notebook tutorial explains the use of admonition notes to improve readability and organization in notebooks, particularly for educational and data science content. It details benefits like highlighting key info, warnings, and structuring complex material using Markdown extensions. A key feature is the `generate_admonition_template` Python function, which creates styled HTML blocks for 15 admonition types with custom icons, colors, and clipboard integration for easy pasting into Markdown cells. |
| [climate_collation](../pages/utilities/climate_collation.md) | The notebooks in scripts/climate_collation process geospatial climate data from the SILO dataset for Great Barrier Reef subcatchments. new_build_reference_table.ipynb creates a reference CSV mapping subcatchments to the 5 km climate grid using area-weighted overlaps in EPSG:3577 projection. build_timeseries.ipynb then extracts daily rainfall and PET timeseries from NetCDF files, computes weighted averages per subcatchment, and collates them into model-ready CSVs. |
